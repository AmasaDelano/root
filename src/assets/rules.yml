- name: Lizard Cult
  color: "#fcf065"
  children:
    - name: Overview
      pretext: Catering to those creatures who have been discarded by the other factions, the Lizard Cult seeks to overwhelm its foes through sheer force of will. The Cult relies on word of mouth and beak to spread its gospel, and new enclaves can spring up anywhere on the map. Where the Cult rule clearings, they can build gardens, which will further radicalize the animals that live there. While other factions spend cards to achieve their aims, the Cult acts chiefly by revealing cards and gradually drafting the ideal set of followers. Unless used for scoring, these cards are not spent and are returned to the Cult’s hand during Evening. However, this gentler approach makes movement and combat operations difficult, so these actions can only be undertaken by the most radicalized members of the Cult.

    - name: Overview
      pretext: When news arrived that the Woodland on the shore of the great lake was descending into all-out war, the Riverfolk Company quickly dispatched its officers to set up shop. As other factions purchase services, the Riverfolk will be able to further entrench their commercial interests by building trade posts across the forest. The construction of these posts is a viable way to score victory points, but so too is the raw accumulation of wealth. However, a big treasury makes for an easy target, and so the Riverfolk must balance protecting their growing treasury with expanding of their operations into the more dangerous clearings of the forest.
